# Django Real Estate Website

This Django-based project was created for learning purposes, specifically to gain hands-on experience in web development and familiarize myself with the Django framework. The project serves as a real estate website where users can browse available houses, contact realtors, log in, and make inquiries.

## Project Overview

The main features of this project include:

- **House Listings**: Users can view a list of available houses with detailed information such as price, location, and property features.
- **Realtor Contact**: Users can easily get in touch with realtors by submitting inquiries about specific houses they are interested in.
- **User Authentication**: The project incorporates user authentication, allowing registered users to log in and access additional features.
- **User Dashboard**: Authenticated users have access to a personalized dashboard panel where they can view all the inquiries they have made.
- **Preventing Duplicate Inquiries**: To ensure data integrity, the system prevents users from making multiple inquiries about the same house. If a user attempts to do so, an error message is displayed.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance and guidance provided by Brad Traversy, a renowned web development instructor. This project was inspired by his online course, and I followed his instructions and utilized the course materials to develop this website. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from his expertise and apply the knowledge gained to create a functional real estate website.
